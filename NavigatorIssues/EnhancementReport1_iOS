Summary:
When entering booking a ticket form, it is not written which fields are required to be filled in with the value, in order to have successful booking. Some users might not see the need for entering e-mail or phone number, and they would have to repeat whole booking procedure because of missing one field. It would be user-friendly is it is stated which fields are required.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Click on 'Sarajevo Theatres' section on Home screen.
2. Select show ‘Buba u uhu’.
3. Click on 'Book a ticket' button.
4. Navigate to Name field and input 'test'.
5. Navigate to Lastname field and input 'test'.
6. Navigate to Phone field and input '0603334441'.
7. Click on 'Book a ticket' button under the displayed form.
Result: Booking request is not sent because E-mail field is empty, and needs to be filled in with the value.

However, there is no expansion, so user cannot read the full name.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Click on Feed button on the bottom of screen.
2. Click on The Martian movie in the Most popular movies category.
3. Scroll down to the Actors section.
Result: Some of the actors' names are not fully displayed.

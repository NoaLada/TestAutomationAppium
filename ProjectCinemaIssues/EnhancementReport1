Summary:
In the Search screen, the real-time search function should not be based on one matching character, but more of them connected in string. When user inputs something like ‘?4-‘, the results are displayed even though the keyword searched has no sense. Input of multiple symbols should limit the search results.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Click on the Search button on the bottom of screen.
2. Navigate to search box.
3. Type in keyword ‘?4:’ using displayed keyboard.
Result: Keyword is properly inputed using keyboard, and the list of possible matching items is displayed. The list contains movies that have relation with number 4 (contained in the movie name or the release order of the movie).
